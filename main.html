                <h2>Products for <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Beginners</h2>
                <p>This website is a toy example, filled with fake products for students to practice their HTML skills.</p>
                <p>In part 1, students practice adding media (images, videos, forms) to this website.</p>
                <p>In part 2, they will practice responsive design.</p>

                <h2>How it Works</h2>
                <p>Students must select tasks from a spreadsheet of options for each part.</p>
                <p>They are scored out of up to 15 points worth of tasks, though they only need to complete 10 points perfectly to get full credit.</p>
                <p>The other points come from participating in their group role, attending group meetings, and of course, their documentation.</p>
                <p>Students are to use Git/GitHub to complete the assignment to track exactly who did what and to get used to a tool that is often used in industry.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Made For You</h2>
                <p>Students are welcome to adapt or change the website as they work on their tasks, though they will only be graded on the tasks that were assigned.</p>
                <p>If students want to create their own tasks, they must ask for approval from the instructor.</p>
                <p>Students may not make changes that would make a task easier. For example, they cannot reduce the number of "products" available or remove sections of text.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Start Your Journey Now</h2>
                <p>This project is a group project, since most computer science related jobs involve working with others. If not teammates, then clients.</p>
                <p>Each student will still be graded individually, both on their work and on their participation as a group member.</p>
                <p>The goal is to mimic a job environment. While most places don't have people who <em>only</em> know <abbr>HTML</abbr>/<abbr>CSS</abbr>, the people who do will often work on a team with people who also know HTML/CSS. Jobs are also typically done on pre-existing websites, which is why students will start with this one.</p>
                <p>The other benefit of a group project is that ideally, most or all of the tasks are complete, showing a website that looks better than it started.</p>
